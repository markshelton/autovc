Abstract: Venture Capital (VC) firms face the challenge of identifying a few outstanding investments from a sea of opportunities. The VC industry requires better systems to manage labour-intensive tasks like investment screening. Previous approaches to improve VC investment screening have common limitations: small privately-collected datasets, a focus on early-stage investment, and limited practical application. A multi-stage supervised classification system was developed that identifies startup companies likely to receive additional funding or have a liquidity event (exit) in the future. The system produces an optimised classification pipeline which is applied to data collected from large, public online databases (CrunchBase and PatentsView). The system was evaluated against three criteria important to the VC industry: predictive power, robustness, and efficiency. The system satisfies each of these criteria. It makes predictions with an average F1 score (for the positive class) of 0.32-0.52 over forecast windows of 2-4 years, it is robust, with only minimal variance in performance when trained on different historical datasets, and it is efficient in that it is semi-autonomous and could be made fully autonomous with minimal development. The prior experience of a startup's advisors, executives and founders was found to be the greatest predictor of investment performance. This project lays the groundwork for an industry-ready VC investment screening tool.
