You’ll find Fordham College at Rose Hill, the Gabelli School of Business, and graduate programs in Arts and Sciences, and Religion and Religious Education here. \r\n\r\nThe campus was established in 1841 as St. John’s College by the Right Rev. John Hughes, Coadjutor-Bishop (later Archbishop) of New York, on old Rose Hill Manor in the village of Fordham, then part of Westchester County. The name Fordham is derived from the Anglo-Saxon words “ford” and “ham,” meaning a wading place or ford by a settlement. \r\n\r\nThe College’s name was officially changed to Fordham University in 1907.",

                  "description": "Mahalo is a human powered search engine founded by Silicon Alley veteran entrepreneur Jason Calacanis.  Results are generated non-algorithmically by a team of profile builders who create pages for search terms.  Mahalo includes the most appropriate hand found links and information about for about 10,000 unique queries.  \r\n\r\nBy 2008 the company hoped to reach 25,000 profiles.  Not unsurprisingly, search results are generated at a limited speed, because of the absence of an automated engine.  However, results pages are often very deep and useful.  Searching queries for which a page has not been created are supplemented with Google search results.  Theoretically, Google users shouldn't have a problem switching over.\r\n\r\nResults pages are a mix between a traditional search layout and Wikipedia.  Any factual information is concisely listed to the side of the all links, while links results are split into different categories with the \"top 7\" heading up the page.  Results categories beyond the top 7 are decided upon by Mahalo guides.  These categories are tailored specifically to the search term.  Thus, a search for a person might include a professional profile, statistics for an athlete or a \"gossip\" section for celebrities.  Searches for companies generally include recent news, products or stock information.  Because search results are ultimately subjective, Mahalo allows users to submit their own links for consideration.  These links are voted on and eventually published or not.\r\n\r\nAlthough the manual creation process will force Mahalo to grow its index very slowly, founder Jason Calacanis claims the company can operate for [four years without any revenue](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/05/30/jason-calacanis-launches-mahalo-today-human-powered-search/).\r\n\r\nMahalo is one of a few substantially funded alternative search engines including [Powerset](http://crunchbase.com/company/powerset), Hakia, [Wikia](http://crunchbase.com/company/wikia), and [ChaCha](http://crunchbase.com/company/chacha).  [Wikipedia](http://crunchbase.com/company/wikipedia) can also be considered a competitor.",

              "description": "Mahalo is a human powered search engine founded by Silicon Alley veteran entrepreneur Jason Calacanis.  Results are generated non-algorithmically by a team of profile builders who create pages for search terms.  Mahalo includes the most appropriate hand found links and information about for about 10,000 unique queries.  \r\n\r\nBy 2008 the company hoped to reach 25,000 profiles.  Not unsurprisingly, search results are generated at a limited speed, because of the absence of an automated engine.  However, results pages are often very deep and useful.  Searching queries for which a page has not been created are supplemented with Google search results.  Theoretically, Google users shouldn't have a problem switching over.\r\n\r\nResults pages are a mix between a traditional search layout and Wikipedia.  Any factual information is concisely listed to the side of the all links, while links results are split into different categories with the \"top 7\" heading up the page.  Results categories beyond the top 7 are decided upon by Mahalo guides.  These categories are tailored specifically to the search term.  Thus, a search for a person might include a professional profile, statistics for an athlete or a \"gossip\" section for celebrities.  Searches for companies generally include recent news, products or stock information.  Because search results are ultimately subjective, Mahalo allows users to submit their own links for consideration.  These links are voted on and eventually published or not.\r\n\r\nAlthough the manual creation process will force Mahalo to grow its index very slowly, founder Jason Calacanis claims the company can operate for [four years without any revenue](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/05/30/jason-calacanis-launches-mahalo-today-human-powered-search/).\r\n\r\nMahalo is one of a few substantially funded alternative search engines including [Powerset](http://crunchbase.com/company/powerset), Hakia, [Wikia](http://crunchbase.com/company/wikia), and [ChaCha](http://crunchbase.com/company/chacha).  [Wikipedia](http://crunchbase.com/company/wikipedia) can also be considered a competitor.",

Dealers are in the dark, having zero awareness or information about the issue. Resultantly, dealers are leaving money on the table from missed service revenue and OEM customer loyalty incentives. \r\n\r\nSolution: CarForce has developed a complete end to end solution that leverages after market telematics to provide real time updates on the health of consumer vehicles. Service centers now have the ability to see service opportunities in real time enabling them to serve their customers by having first right of refusal, order parts more quickly, and offer their customers an on-demand concierge experience.\r\n\r\nManagement: CarForce was founded by Jessika Lora, the former Head of Automotive Partnerships and GM of eBay’s Vehicles C2C business. While at eBay Motors, the world’s #1 automotive marketplace, she managed strategy and operations for a $7.3 billion dollar business and led the turn around of eBay’s $1.6 billion dollar consumer-to-consumer vehicle sector with double-digit growth. She developed her results driven track record as a management consultant for Deloitte Consulting and is a Stanford BS and MS graduate with 10+ years of automotive and e-commerce experience.",

From an employer’s perspective, by allowing job shadowing, an HR manager is able to influence and drive the market to fulfill their unmet hiring needs to solve problems like lack of diversity or high demand and not enough supply for a position.  Additionally, 65% of people look for a new job within 91 days of being hired and 52% of people say they think they would be more successful in a job they found themselves than one a recruiter found them or one in which they were contacted by a company.  We aim to aid in the challenge of turnover and bad hires by empowering students and career changers to seek out jobs themselves and experience a day in the life of that job.",
