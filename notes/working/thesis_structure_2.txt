1. Introduction (1,500 Words)
    - Rationale
        - Technological advances have made launching startups more accessible than ever before. --> more startups
        - Startups seek venture capital investment to support them through their development. --> more investment
        - Venture capitalists have difficulty finding investments that can provide highly profitable liquidity events. --> more difficulty
        - Data mining may be able to make investment screening more efficient and effective. --> solution
    - Aim: To develop a viable system that will assist venture capitalists in screening investment candidates.
    - Criteria
        - Efficient: The system must be more efficient than traditional, manual investment screening.
        - Robust: The system must be robust enough to be reliable over time and agnostic to specific data sources.
        - Powerful: The system must be consistent in identifying high-potential candidates with high sensitivity.
