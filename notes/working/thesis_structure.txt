1. Introduction (1,500 Words)
    - Rationale
        - Technological advances have made launching startups more accessible than ever before.
        - Startups seek venture capital investment to support them through their development.
        - Venture capitalists have difficulty finding investments that can provide highly profitable liquidity events.
        - Data mining may be able to make investment screening more efficient and effective.
    - Aim
        - We aim to develop a system that will assist venture capitalists in screening investment candidates.
    - Criteria
        - Efficiency: Our system must be more efficient than traditional, manual investment screening.
        - Robustness: Our system must be robust enough to be reliable over time and agnostic to specific data sources.
        - Predictive Power: Our system must be consistently accurate at identifying a variety of high-potential investment candidates.
    - Signposting
        - Literature Review: We review the theory of startups and startup investment and previous attempts at using data mining in this domain.
        - Design & Implementation: We outline our system architecture: covering data collection, pre-processing, classification and our experimental setup.
        - Evaluation: We report the results of our experiments on our three criteria: efficiency, robustness and predictive power.
        - Discussion: Finally, we discuss our findings and their implications for investors and future research into startup investment and performance.

2. Literature Review (3,000 Words)
    2.0 Introduction
        - In this chapter, we explore the theoretical background of startup performance and then break the research down into three intercorrelated problems: feature selection, data sources and classification algorithms.
        - Theoretical Background: 
        - Feature Selection: 
        - Data Sources: 
        - Classification Algorithms: 
    2.1 Theoretical Background
        2.1.0 Introduction
            - 
        2.1.1 Technology Startups
            - Introduction: Startups perform a critical economic role and it is important for us to understand what drives their success.
            - Determinants: Unlike traditional businesses, startup performance is primarily driven by internal factors and is robust to changes in product and market.
                - Human Capital: Early-stage startups have little financial and structural capital and so rely on human capital to drive company growth.
                - Social Capital: 
                - Structural Capital: 
                - Link to Funding: 
            - Lifecycle: Although startups travel distinct paths, their development can be roughly tracked by the progression of their external funding.
                - Figure: An idealised depiction of the startup development lifecycle as demarcated by external funding (adapted, CITATION).
            - Benefits: Venture capital-backed firms grow faster, patent more, have higher productivity and are more likely to go public (CITATIONS).
            - Exits: Startups seek opportunities to return value investors and other equity-holders, generally in the form of an IPO or acquisition.
        2.1.2 Startup Investment
            - Introduction: 
            - Venture Capital Firm Strategy
                - Figure: Venture capital fund lifecycle (graphic)
            - Screening: 
            - Decisions: 
        2.1.3 Proposed Framework
            - External investment is a key driver of startup development. However, our understanding of factors that influence startup investment is incomplete.
                - Figure: Proposed conceptual framework for startup investment (tree).
    2.3 Feature Selection
        - We seek to operationalise our conceptual framework into features we can incorporate into our machine learning model.
            - Table: Features indicated to be relevant to startup investment.
    2.2 Data Sources
        2.2.0 Introduction
            - A diverse range of features is critical to developing accurate models of startup performance and investment decisions.
                - Table: A review of data sources indicated to be relevant to venture capital investment screening.
        2.2.1 Source Characteristics - Databases, Social Media, Other
            - Entrepreneurship research is transforming with the availability of online data sources: databases, websites and social networks.
            - Databases play a critical role in understanding the startup ecosystem, aggregating information about startups, investors, media and trends.
            - CrunchBase is a large open online crowd-sourced database focused on the high-tech industry in the United States.
            - AngelList is a US-based equity crowdfunding platform that provides syndicated pre-seed and seed rounds to sophisticated investors.
            - Social networks provide an interesting perspective into the process of opportunity discovery and capitalisation that characterises entrepreneurship.
            - LinkedIn is a massive professional social network often used in studies of entrepreneurship for measures of employment, education and weak social links.
            - Twitter is a massive social networking and micro-blogging service used by founders, investors, startups and customers to quickly communicate and broadcast.
            - US Patents View is the recently launched online portal for the US Patents Office (c.2015), it holds over 12 million patent filings from 1976 onwards.
            - PrivCo is one of few commercial data sources for private company business and financial intelligence.
        2.2.2 Source Evaluation
            - Entrepreneurship and venture capital research is primed to take advantage of the availability of new online data sources.

            - What is Machine Learning?
            - We evaluated common machine learning algorithms with respect to their suitability for modelling startup investment decisions.

        2.4.3 Algorithm Evaluation
            - Introduction: 
    2.5 Research Gap
        - The venture capital industry requires better systems and processes to efficiently manage labour-intensive tasks like investment screening.
        - We conducted a literature review to determine how to produce a system that will assist venture capitalists in screening investment candidates.
        - Existing approaches in the literature have three common limitations: small sample size, a focus on early-stage investment, and incomplete use of features.
        - We believe it is now possible to address previous limitations in this domain and produce an investment screening system that is efficient, robust and powerful.
