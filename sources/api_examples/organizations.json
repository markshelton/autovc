It supports languages such as [Ruby](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ruby), [Java](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/java), [Node.js](https://www.crunchbase.com/product/node-js), [Clojure](https://www.crunchbase.com/product/clojure), [Python](https://www.crunchbase.com/product/python), PHP, Perl, and Scala.\n\nApplications that are run from the in-house server utilize the Heroku DNS server to direct to the application domain. Each of the application containers or “dynos” are spread across a “dyno grid” that consists of several servers.\n\nHeroku was founded by [James Lindenbaum](https://www.crunchbase.com/person/james-lindenbaum) and [Adam Wiggins](https://www.crunchbase.com/person/adam-wiggins) in July 2007 and is based in San Francisco, California, U.S.A. The company was acquired by [Salesforce](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/salesforce) in 2011 but operates independently from their office in San Francisco.",

There's nothing more exciting, in my eyes, than taking an idea and making it a reality.\r\n\r\nI love formulating startup strategies ranging from product marketing, user acquisition, marketing initiatives, to helping develop technical architectures and product functionality. I'm a big advocate of the Lean Startup; pivoting is no longer just a basketball move.\r\n\r\nProfessional interests aside, I'm a fan of golfing, hiking, exploring San Francisco and the greater Bay Area, and spending time with my amazing friends and family. I've also been bitten by the theoretical physics bug; fascinating stuff!",

An accomplished venture investor, private equity principal, company advisor, and entrepreneur, Chris manages a portfolio of over fifty consumer web, mobile, and wireless technology start- ups as well as an array of mature enterprises through his holding company, Lowercase Capital.\r\n\r\nPreviously, Chris served as Head of Special Initiatives at Google Inc. In that role, among other responsibilities, he founded and headed up the alternative access and wireless divisions. Before joining Google, Chris held a number of executive roles at one of the world's largest streaming and digital media distribution companies, Speedera Networks (acquired by Akamai Technologies), and was ultimately responsible for their legal and corporate development efforts.\r\n\r\nPrior to Speedera, Chris was an attorney with the Silicon Valley law firm of Fenwick & West where he handled venture capital, mergers & acquisitions, and licensing transactions for technology clients such as Macromedia, VeriSign, and Kleiner Perkins. \r\n\r\nIn 2008, Chris proudly worked on President Barack Obama's campaign as a Telecommunications, Media, and Technology advisor, a speaking surrogate, a field office volunteer, and as Co-Chair of Finance and a Trustee of the Presidential Inaugural Committee.\r\n\r\nThe Wall Street Journal cited Chris as \"possibly the most influential businessman in America\" and Chris was the youngest member of the Forbes 2011 Midas List. Chris is a fixture in the Silicon Valley startup community, and as a result of his reputation for fruitful and fun collaborations with early stage companies he was named as one of the top 10 angel investors in the country by Business Week.\r\n\r\nChris was recently recognized as a Henry Crown Fellow of the Aspen Institute, annually selecting 20 of the world's most promising leaders and public servants under the age of 45 and he also serves as an Associate Fellow of the Said Business School at Oxford University. \r\n\r\nChris regularly appears on television, radio, and in print and has been featured in Business Week, Fortune, Fast Company, and on CNBC, BBC, CNN, FOX, and NPR as an expert in the realms of entrepreneurism, venture capital, and disruptive technologies. \r\n\r\nIn parallel with his frequent keynotes at technology industry events, Chris is perennially hired by many of the world's largest companies, financial institutions, universities, and governments to speak about innovation, workplace design, and business strategy in a digital era. \r\n\r\nChris graduated cum laude from Georgetown University Law Center where he was a member of The Tax Lawyer law review and was honored as the school's Philip A. Ryan and Ralph J. Gilbert Memorial Scholar. He also graduated cum laude from the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University and was an Edmund Evans Memorial Scholar as well as a Weeks Family Foundation Scholar. \r\n\r\nDuring his studies, Chris attended university at each of Universidad CatÃ³lica del Ecuador in Quito, Ecuador, University College Cork, in Cork, Ireland, and the Universidad Complutense in Madrid, Spain. Long before that, beginning in 6th grade, Chris attended the State University of New York at Buffalo for six years of graduate- level mathematics classes wearing thick glasses, awkward braces, and knowing the entire time that technology and computers would be passions of his for life.\r\n\r\nAlways taught by his parents the importance of giving back to those who need our help, Chris dedicates much of his time to helping charity:water and Lance Armstrong's LIVESTRONG Foundation and, if you spend any time with him, he will likely rope you into doing your part as well. \r\n\r\nWhen not on the road for his companies, or huddled up in the cramped apartments and coffeeshops where his entrepreneurs often write their code, Chris lives in Truckee, California, is an avid Pacifica surfer, San Mateo kitesurfer, Lake Tahoe skier, two-time Ironman triathlete, and he recently bicycled coast-to-coast across the United States of America.",
