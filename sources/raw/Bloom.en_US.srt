00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,920
Bloom has just opened my eyes to a different definition of success.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,760
So I started Bloom when I was 18-years-old,

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,840
just at the start of my second year at university,

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,619
and the reason why I started it was I was actually involved in

5
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:20,480
another student-run social enterprise called Teach Learn Grow,

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,640
but I just realised, you know, how little students

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,000
felt like they could actually start business or not-for-profits like that.

8
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:34,680
I think the immediate benefit is just the current people that are in here,

9
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:40,880
you know, really turning their ideas into tangible products that really inspire a next generation.

10
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,680
The more and more time I spent here, surrounded by these people,

11
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,740
the more and more I was kind of like ‘Oh, you know, maybe I could do a startup’,

12
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:49,800
and I think other people also feel that when they come into the space.

13
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:58,720
So, the two startups that got funding recently were Veri.Vote and Jurimetrics.

14
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,020
I'm Adrian, I'm CEO of Veri.Vote

15
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,020
and we've been working out of Bloom for the last 8 months,

16
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:05,760
and essentially what we're trying to do

17
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,080
is fix all of the problems that we see with voting.

18
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:13,140
I don't think in 2016 you should be voting with a piece of paper and a pencil,

19
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,180
and we want to bring democracy into the digital age.

20
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:24,700
So Jurimetrics is a legal technology startup.

21
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:29,140
Essentially what it does is collect information from legal and regulatory decisions.

22
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:31,920
Those statistics are then used to make better business decisions.

23
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,600
So, first thing I did was go to Mark, and I said,

24
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,020
"Mark, we're looking to create a prototype, we need a front end web designer."

25
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:40,430
Mark simply turned around and pointed to one guy sitting at a desk,

26
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:44,230
just across from him, and he's been working with us for the past 3 or 4 months.

27
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:52,380
Gecko Steps runs a Perth-based nanny agency,

28
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,580
where we link families and nannies together,

29
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,060
and we also run an educational programme

30
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:58,740
which runs coding and programming workshops

31
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:01,220
in high schools and primary schools around Perth.

32
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:06,640
Cultured is an information service for backpackers and international students.

33
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,960
We provide an insight into Perth's culture from a local student's perspective.

34
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,780
We're really proud of the fact that we have

35
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:17,460
a very diverse group of members and students that are working with us.

36
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,470
I think that it's so important to be able to have

37
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:23,200
people working side by side from different disciplines.

38
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,040
That's where you get really interesting, exciting things happening,

39
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,720
that's how innovation works.

40
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:36,160
St. Catherine's college has been an amazing partner for Bloom.

41
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,780
They really stood up to help us out when we were really at the start,

42
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,100
and gave us this space but they gave us much more than that

43
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:45,480
in terms of the sort of support and nurturing us as well.

44
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,180
I think they're kind of proving a university college

45
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:51,120
is much more than just a place for students to sleep.

46
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,220
You're exposed to really high quality people everyday

47
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:57,680
with just a huge range of ideas that are floating around the space.

48
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,040
So you feel like you're really part of the energy and part of a really positive environment.

49
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,860
Innovation is really not just about a single person,

50
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,900
it's about a community coming together.
